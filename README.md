# Sonus Flow
## For a smooth, natural listening experience.

Sonus Flow is a Web Application run using Streamlit API and deployed using Streamlit Community Cloud.

Have come across Solo leveling???
It got really famous recently because of the anime Adaptation it recently recieved. 
Solo leveling like many other amazing series started from a book series which is posted on the web called web novels or light novels.
I have been a religious reader of light novel so much so that I listen to them while doing monotonic tasks like chores.
But light novels are website based texts so I use an app called  Speechify which unfortunately restricts free users.
And that is why I wanted something that I can personally use without restrictions for number of times I can convert.

Sonus Flow is just a personal project which takes in any chapter from any novel from "https://novelbin.com/" and converts it into audio file one at a time.
The whole project is in python.
I used requests module for scraping the content and Beautiful Soup for retrieving and organizing the content.
I used google clouds Text-to-Speech python package called GTTS.
I used streamlit to make a WebApp and to stream/play the audio online I used pydub which in-turn uses ffmpeg.
I have also included the download button and also the next chapter button for everyone to seamlessly start the next chapter.
This is but a first iteration.
It will be updated according to my needs and desires.
If you want to use it. Here is the link "https://sonus-flow-btyqk5uzaxjkwowbzrmp9h.streamlit.app/"

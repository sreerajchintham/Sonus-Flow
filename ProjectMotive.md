# Why I Started This Project

Have you heard of *Solo Leveling*? It recently became famous due to its anime adaptation. But before that, it started as a web novel—just like many other great stories that exist only as online text.  

I’ve been a dedicated reader of light novels, and I love listening to them while doing monotonous tasks like chores. However, most light novels exist only as website-based text, making it difficult to listen to them conveniently.  

I used **Speechify**, but it restricts free users. That’s when I decided to create my own tool—something I could use without limitations.  

> Sonus means "sound" in Latin. Sonus Flow represents the smooth flow of sound from a novel chapter.

### **The Vision Behind Sonus Flow**  
Sonus Flow is a personal project designed to:   
- Enable me (and others) to listen to web novels freely.  
- Provide an easy way to convert text-based light novels into audio.  
- Be a simple and effective alternative to paid tools like Speechify.  

This is just the first version, and I plan to update it based on my needs and improvements. If you're interested, feel free to check it out!
